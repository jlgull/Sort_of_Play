# Sort a group of items; integers, floating point or string.

    # Define the clear function, which is agnostic to the operating system
    # being used. In PyCharm you have to sent "Emulate terminal in output console",
    # which is found under the "Edit run configuration" tab.

    """ name    - The name of the operating system dependent module imported. 
                    The following names have currently been registered: 'posix', 'nt', 'java'.

        system  - Execute the command (a string) in a subshell. 
                    This is implemented by calling the Standard C function system(), and has the same 
                    limitations. Changes to sys.stdin, etc. are not reflected in the environment of the
                    executed command. If command generates any output, it will be sent to the interpreter
                    standard output stream. The C standard does not specify the meaning of the return value 
                    of the C function, so the return value of the Python function is system-dependent. """
